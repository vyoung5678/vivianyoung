      <p>Once you begin instruction, you will need to practice what you learned and meet new friends who share your passion.  
      Also known as "socials," you can expect to meet dancers with whom you take lessons as well as dancers who study at 
      different dance studios.  You will also find seasoned dancers who have studied in the past and are regular attendees.
      Don't be shy about dancing with people who have more experience than you.  They will help you to improve and grow. 
      Any of the three parties below will assist you in getting more comfortable in a social environment.  Click the links below and choose one or more that are convenient for you.</p>
