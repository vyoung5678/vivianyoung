      <p>Unlike most partner dances that have just one basic step to learn, west coast swing dancing requires one to learn six 
      separate basic steps.  In addition, the leader and follower steps do not mirror each other as is common in other dances. 
      But don't get discouraged.  In time, each of the basic steps will become easy to remember and execute.  And, remember, no 
      partner is required.  Students will be matched with a partner and will rotate to get opportunities to practice with everyone.
      There are currently two studios that offer west coast swing instruction.  Use the links below to search for suitable days and times that work for you.</p>
