    <h2>What is <strong>west coast swing</strong>?</h2>
  </div>
  <div class="paragraph">
        <p>West coast swing is one of the dances in the swing family. The origins of west coast swing are found in lindy hop, which is danced in rotational patterns. When lindy dancers were asked to perform in a film and the 
        camera frame was unable to fit all the dancers, they were asked to dance in a slot.  That's when west coast swing was born. Unlike ballroom dances, there are six basic west coast swing patterns that must be mastered.
        To the untrained eye, it is difficult to identify the basic patterns when variations are applied.  In time, that will change.  Once the learner becomes more comfortable with the basic patterns and a few variations 
        learned in class, it is time to begin attending parties.  Parties can be held at studios as free practice sessions for those attending classes; weekly or monthly social dances held in various venues around the city; or 
        dance conventions that are held during weekends all around the world where one can take additional workshops, dance socially, or compete.  The video below is an example of west coast swing dancing.

        <h2>Getting Started</h2>

  <div class="paragraph">
        <p>Do I need a partner?  That is the most frequently asked question.  No, a partner is not required.  Dancers are rotated throughout the class so that everyone dances with each other.
        There is also no specific role for males or females.  Anyone can be the follower and anyone can be the leader.  The first thing you need to do is find an appropriate class that is 
        conveniently located and held on a day and time that suits your schedule. You will be given the opportunity to register for a multi-week class for a reduced price of taking single classes.  In order to get a good grasp of the 
        dance, you will be encouraged to register for a full session.  It is common to repeat full sessions if the student needs additional time to master the basic steps.  The instructor will let you know when you are ready to move on to the next level.

        <p>Once again, the most frequently asked question regarding parties is, Do I need a partner?  And, once again, there is no need to bring a partner.  As is common in classes, dancers at parties circulate and ask
        each other to dance.  There is no rule that says leaders must ask followers.  Followers also do the asking.  It's a 50-50 situation, so there is no risk of being a wall flower.  Currently, there are parties scheduled the first three Saturdays of
        every month and a Wednesday night weekly party.  Click on the appropriate link below to find locations and pricing.</p>
